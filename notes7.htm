Coal and Petroleum ‚Äì Class 8 Science Notes
1. Coal
Definition: Coal is a black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that is combustible and mainly contains carbon.

Formation:

Formed from plant remains buried under soil and rock millions of years ago.

Over time, heat and pressure converted it into coal.

Types of Coal (Based on Carbon Content):

Type	    Carbon %	Energy-Content	Use
Peat	    <50%        Low	          Fuel in villages
Lignite   50‚Äì70%	    Medium	      Fuel for electricity
Bituminous 70‚Äì85%	    High	        Industries, power plants
Anthracite	>85%	   Very-high	    Industries requiring high heat
Uses of Coal:

Fuel for electricity (thermal power plants)

Fuel for industries like steel and cement

Making coke (used in metallurgy)

2. Petroleum
Definition: Petroleum is a naturally occurring liquid mixture of hydrocarbons, found in underground reservoirs.

Formation:

Formed from remains of marine plants and animals over millions of years.

Heat and pressure converted them into crude oil (petroleum).

Extraction:

Drilled from underground oil wells.

Separated into useful products by fractional distillation.

3. Fractional Distillation of Petroleum
Process: Crude oil is heated ‚Üí different fractions evaporate at different temperatures ‚Üí condensed into liquids.

Fractions & Uses:

Fraction	Boiling Point	Use
Petrol (Gasoline)	40‚Äì200¬∞C	Fuel for cars
Kerosene	150‚Äì250¬∞C	Fuel for lamps, jets
Diesel	200‚Äì300¬∞C	Fuel for trucks, buses
Lubricating oil	>300¬∞C	Lubricants
Bitumen	>350¬∞C	Roads, roofing
Paraffin wax	‚Äì	Candles, cosmetics
4. Natural Gas
Often found with petroleum.

Mainly methane (CH‚ÇÑ).

Uses:

Fuel for cooking (LPG)

Electricity generation

Making chemicals and fertilizers

5. Importance of Fossil Fuels
Provide energy for industries, vehicles, electricity, and homes.

Source of many products like plastics, medicines, synthetic materials.

6. Environmental Concerns
Burning coal/petroleum produces carbon dioxide, causing global warming.

Mining and oil spills can pollute land and water.

Shift to renewable energy is encouraged.

‚úÖ Tip for Exams:

Remember the types of coal and fractions of petroleum with their uses.

Draw a simple diagram of fractional distillation ‚Äî NCERT loves diagrams.</pre>

<div class="note-card"><pre>Combustion and Flame ‚Äì Class 8 Science Notes
1. Combustion

Definition: Combustion is a chemical process in which a substance reacts with oxygen and releases heat and light.

General Equation:

Fuel + Oxygen ‚Üí Heat + Light (+ products)


Types of Combustion:

Complete Combustion:

Fuel burns in plenty of oxygen.

Produces carbon dioxide (CO‚ÇÇ) and water (H‚ÇÇO).

Example: Burning LPG, kerosene, wood in plenty of air.

Equation (methane):

CH‚ÇÑ + 2O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí CO‚ÇÇ + 2H‚ÇÇO + Heat


Incomplete Combustion:

Fuel burns in limited oxygen.

Produces carbon monoxide (CO), soot (C), water, and less heat.

Example: Burning wood, kerosene in a closed room.

Equation (methane):

2CH‚ÇÑ + 3O‚ÇÇ ‚Üí 2CO + 4H‚ÇÇO + Heat


Observations:

Complete combustion ‚Üí blue flame, no soot.

Incomplete combustion ‚Üí yellow/sooty flame, smoky.

2. Flame

Definition: A flame is a visible, gaseous part of a burning substance.

Structure of a Candle Flame:
A candle flame has three zones:

Zone	Location	Characteristics
Inner zone	Closest to wick	Dark, luminous, least hot, unburnt wax vapour
Middle zone	Surrounding inner zone	Yellow, luminous, partially burnt wax
Outer zone	Outer edge of flame	Blue, hottest, complete combustion occurs

Flame Colors:

Blue ‚Üí complete combustion (hottest)

Yellow ‚Üí incomplete combustion (sooty)

3. Uses of Combustion

Provides heat and light.

Fuels engines (cars, planes).

Used in cooking and industries.

4. Safety Measures

Avoid burning fuel in closed rooms ‚Üí risk of CO poisoning.

Keep flammable materials away from fire.

Use proper ventilation when using kerosene, LPG, or gas stoves.

‚úÖ Tip for Exams:

Draw a diagram of candle flame with 3 zones.

Remember complete vs incomplete combustion differences (color, products, heat).</pre></div>
